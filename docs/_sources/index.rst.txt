Seeq SysID Add-on
=========================================



`Seeq-System Identification <https://github.com/BYU-PRISM/Seeq>`_ is a Seeq Add-on built in python to identify
input and output relationship for the system to create **digital twin** models
for various analytics and machine learning tasks. System dynamics are
identified thereby allowing users to get dynamic predictions quickly.
The Add-on is fully integrated with Seeq Workbench. Cleaned and contexutalized
data from Seeq workbench can be used to identify dynamic models; the models
can be pushed back into Seeq workbench. This framework supports both adhoc
investigations as well as streaming predictions.
The system identification framework can be used for a variety of tasks
including simulation, digital twin construction, advanced process control,
real time optimization, etc.
